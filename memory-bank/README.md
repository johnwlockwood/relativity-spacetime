# Memory Bank

## Overview
This directory serves as a knowledge repository for tasks completed in the project. It contains documentation of completed tasks, commands used, and technical decisions made throughout the development process.

## Contents

- **Task Summaries**: Files named `task-summary-[task-name].md` that document individual tasks
- **Task History**: A chronological record of tasks with links to their branches and summaries
- **Documentation Instructions**: Guidelines for maintaining this memory bank
- **Command History**: Record of useful commands and their purposes

## Purpose

The memory bank helps:
1. Track the history of work done on the project
2. Document technical decisions and their rationale
3. Provide reference for future similar tasks
4. Preserve knowledge that might otherwise be lost
5. Assist in onboarding new team members

## How to Use

1. After completing a task, create a new task summary file
2. Follow the format outlined in `documentation-instructions.md`
3. Include all relevant information, especially successful commands and key decisions
4. Reference these documents when working on similar tasks in the future

## Maintenance

This directory should be maintained as part of the regular development workflow. Each completed task should be documented here before moving on to the next task.
