# Task History

This file maintains a chronological record of tasks completed in the project, associating each task with its corresponding git branch and summary file.

## Task History Log

| Date | Task | Branch | Summary File | Description |

## Purpose

This task history log serves several important purposes:

1. **Traceability**: Links tasks to their implementation branches and documentation
2. **Project Timeline**: Provides a chronological view of project development
3. **Knowledge Management**: Makes it easy to find task summaries for reference
4. **Onboarding**: Helps new team members understand the project's evolution

## Maintenance Guidelines

When completing a task:

1. Add a new row to the table above with:
   - The current date
   - A short task name
   - The git branch name where the task was implemented
   - A link to the task summary file
   - A brief description of the task

2. Keep entries in reverse chronological order (newest at the top)

3. Ensure the branch name accurately reflects the task's purpose

4. Make sure the link to the task summary file is relative and correct
