# Task Summary: Add Initial Spacetime Elements

## Task Description
Create a new git branch and port the spacetime visualization from the prototype directory to the main Three.js scene in the src directory, replacing the rotating green cube with a spacetime grid and Earth visualization, and including the mass slider control.

## Steps Completed

1. Created a new git branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-spacetime-elements
   ```

2. Created the Satellite class in the src directory:
   ```typescript
   // src/Satellite.ts
   import * as THREE from 'three';

   export class Satellite extends THREE.Mesh {
       clock: number;
       clockRate: number;

       constructor(geometry: THREE.SphereGeometry, material: THREE.MeshPhongMaterial) {
           super(geometry, material);
           this.clock = 0;
           this.clockRate = 1;
       }
   }
   ```

3. Updated the main.ts file to:
   - Import the Satellite class
   - Add physics constants (G, c, etc.)
   - Replace the rotating green cube with:
     - A blue Earth sphere
     - A deformable orange wireframe spacetime grid
   - Add the mass slider UI element
   - Implement the grid deformation function based on mass
   - Add event listeners for the mass slider

4. Updated the CSS in style.css to:
   - Add styles for the UI container
   - Add styles for the slider container
   - Ensure proper positioning and appearance of UI elements

5. Updated the layout to match the prototype:
   - Made the Three.js scene take up the entire window
   - Positioned the UI controls in a box with a light gray background in the top left corner
   - Simplified the HTML structure to remove unnecessary container elements

## Result
Successfully implemented the spacetime visualization with a mass slider control. The visualization shows how mass affects spacetime, with the grid deforming more as the mass increases. This visually demonstrates Einstein's theory of general relativity, where mass curves spacetime.

## Key Technical Decisions
- Ported only the essential elements from the prototype (Earth, grid, mass slider)
- Omitted the satellites, receiver, and other sliders as requested
- Maintained the same physics calculations and grid deformation algorithm
- Adapted the UI to match the existing application style
- Positioned the UI elements to work well with the Three.js scene

## Notes and Improvements
- The implementation provides a clear visualization of how mass affects spacetime
- The mass slider allows for interactive exploration of different mass values
- The grid deformation is properly scaled for visibility
- The Earth sphere provides a reference point for the spacetime deformation
- The fullscreen layout provides a more immersive experience
- The UI controls are easily accessible in the top left corner
- Future improvements could include adding the other sliders and elements from the prototype
