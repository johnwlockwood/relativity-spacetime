# Documentation Instructions

## Purpose
This file outlines the documentation process that should be followed at the end of each completed task. Maintaining this documentation helps track work history, preserve knowledge, and provide reference for future tasks.

## Documentation Process

At the end of each task, create or update the following:

1. **Task Summary File**
   - Create a new file in the `memory-bank` directory named `task-summary-[task-name].md`
   - Include the following sections:
     - Task Description
     - Steps Completed (with commands used)
     - Result
     - Key Technical Decisions
     - Any challenges encountered and how they were resolved

2. **Command History**
   - Document all successful commands used during the task
   - Include explanations of what each command does
   - Note any important flags or options used

3. **Update Task List** (if applicable)
   - If maintaining a task list, mark the completed task
   - Add any new tasks that were identified during the current task

## Benefits
