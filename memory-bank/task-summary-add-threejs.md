# Task Summary: Add Three.js with TypeScript Support

## Task Description
Create a new git branch and add Three.js to a Vite project with TypeScript, avoiding type errors.

## Steps Completed

### Initial Implementation with CDN

1. Created a new git branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-threejs
   ```

2. Added Three.js CDN to index.html:
   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.160.0/build/three.min.js"></script>
   ```

3. Installed Three.js type definitions:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @types/three
   ```

4. Created a type declaration file for the global THREE object:
   ```typescript
   // src/types/three-cdn.d.ts
   import * as ThreeNamespace from 'three';

   declare global {
     const THREE: typeof ThreeNamespace;
   }
   ```

5. Updated main.ts to use Three.js with proper TypeScript support:
   - Added a Three.js scene with a rotating cube
   - Used the global THREE object from the CDN
   - Ensured TypeScript type checking works correctly

### Migration to ES Modules

6. Installed Three.js as a dependency:
   ```bash
   npm install three@0.174.0
   ```

7. Removed the CDN script from index.html

8. Updated main.ts to import Three.js directly:
   ```typescript
   import * as THREE from 'three'
   ```

9. Removed the type declaration file as it's no longer needed

## Result
Successfully implemented Three.js with proper TypeScript support. The application displays a rotating green cube rendered with Three.js alongside the original Vite + TypeScript content.

## Key Technical Decisions
- Initially used the CDN version of Three.js (v0.160.0) for runtime
- Migrated to ES Modules with Three.js v0.174.0 as recommended by Three.js
- Used proper TypeScript imports for type safety and better IDE support
- Removed the need for a custom type declaration file

## Notes and Improvements
- Migrated from CDN to ES Modules to follow Three.js recommendations
- Upgraded from v0.160.0 to v0.174.0 (latest version)
- Eliminated console warnings about deprecated scripts
- Improved type safety with direct imports
- Better tree-shaking and bundling with ES Modules
