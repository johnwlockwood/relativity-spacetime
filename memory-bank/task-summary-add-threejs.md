# Task Summary: Add Three.js from CDN with TypeScript Support

## Task Description
Create a new git branch and add Three.js from a CDN in a Vite project with TypeScript, avoiding type errors.

## Steps Completed

1. Created a new git branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-threejs
   ```

2. Added Three.js CDN to index.html:
   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.160.0/build/three.min.js"></script>
   ```

3. Installed Three.js type definitions:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @types/three
   ```

4. Created a type declaration file for the global THREE object:
   ```typescript
   // src/types/three-cdn.d.ts
   import * as ThreeNamespace from 'three';

   declare global {
     const THREE: typeof ThreeNamespace;
   }
   ```

5. Updated main.ts to use Three.js with proper TypeScript support:
   - Added a Three.js scene with a rotating cube
   - Used the global THREE object from the CDN
   - Ensured TypeScript type checking works correctly

6. Added CSS styles for the Three.js container

## Result
Successfully implemented Three.js from a CDN with proper TypeScript support. The application now displays a rotating green cube rendered with Three.js alongside the original Vite + TypeScript content.

## Key Technical Decisions
- Used the CDN version of Three.js (v0.160.0) for runtime
- Used @types/three for TypeScript type definitions
- Created a type declaration file to connect the global THREE object to TypeScript types

## Notes and Warnings
- The Three.js CDN scripts "build/three.js" and "build/three.min.js" are deprecated with r150+ and will be removed with r160
- The console shows a warning suggesting to use ES Modules or alternatives instead
- Attempted to use the newer version (0.174.0) with "three.tsl.min.js" but encountered errors
- Kept version 0.160.0 which works correctly with the current implementation
