# Task Summary: Add 3D Earth Model

## Task Description
Replace the simple Earth sphere in the scene with a detailed 3D Earth model from the planet_earth directory using the GLTFLoader.

## Steps Completed

1. Identified that the GLTFLoader was already imported in the main.ts file:
   ```typescript
   import { GLTFLoader } from 'three/addons/loaders/GLTFLoader.js';
   ```

2. Added an import for the Earth model using Vite's URL import feature:
   ```typescript
   import earthModelPath from './planet_earth/scene.gltf?url';
   ```

3. Replaced the Earth sphere creation code with code to load the 3D model:
   ```typescript
   // Earth - Load 3D model
   let earth: THREE.Object3D | null = null;
   const loader = new GLTFLoader();
   loader.load(
     earthModelPath,
     (gltf) => {
       earth = gltf.scene;
       // Scale the model appropriately
       earth.scale.set(2, 2, 2);
       // Center the model
       earth.position.set(0, 0, 0);
       // Add the model to the scene
       scene.add(earth);
       
       // Apply materials to all meshes in the model for better appearance
       earth.traverse((child) => {
         if (child instanceof THREE.Mesh) {
           // Enhance material properties
           if (child.material) {
             child.material.needsUpdate = true;
             if (Array.isArray(child.material)) {
               child.material.forEach(mat => {
                 // Make material opaque
                 mat.transparent = false;
                 mat.opacity = 1.0;
                 if (mat.shininess !== undefined) {
                   mat.shininess = 30;
                 }
               });
             } else {
               // Make material opaque
               child.material.transparent = false;
               child.material.opacity = 1.0;
               if (child.material.shininess !== undefined) {
                 child.material.shininess = 30;
               }
             }
           }
         }
       });
     },
     (xhr) => {
       console.log((xhr.loaded / xhr.total * 100) + '% loaded');
     },
     (error) => {
       console.error('An error happened loading the Earth model:', error);
       // Fallback to simple sphere if model fails to load
       const earthGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(earthRadius, 32, 32);
       const earthMaterial = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({
         color: "rgb(92, 190, 239)",
         transparent: true,
         opacity: 0.99,
         shininess: 30
       });
       earth = new THREE.Mesh(earthGeometry, earthMaterial);
       scene.add(earth);
     }
   );
   ```

4. Enhanced the lighting to better illuminate the Earth model:
   ```typescript
   // Add lights - enhanced for better Earth illumination
   const ambientLight = new THREE.AmbientLight(0xffffff, 1.0) // Increased intensity and whiter light
   scene.add(ambientLight)

   // Main directional light (sun-like)
   const directionalLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 1.5) // Increased intensity
   directionalLight.position.set(-5, 5, 3)
   scene.add(directionalLight)

   // Add multiple point lights to highlight the Earth model from different angles
   const pointLight1 = new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff, 1.5, 100)
   pointLight1.position.set(2, 3, 4)
   scene.add(pointLight1)
   
   const pointLight2 = new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff, 1.0, 100)
   pointLight2.position.set(-3, 2, 5)
   scene.add(pointLight2)
   
   const pointLight3 = new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff, 1.0, 100)
   pointLight3.position.set(4, -2, 3)
   scene.add(pointLight3)
   
   // Add a spotlight specifically targeting the Earth
   const spotLight = new THREE.SpotLight(0xffffff, 2.0)
   spotLight.position.set(10, 10, 10)
   spotLight.angle = Math.PI / 6
   spotLight.penumbra = 0.2
   spotLight.decay = 1
   spotLight.distance = 50
   spotLight.target.position.set(0, 0, 0) // Target the center where Earth is
   scene.add(spotLight)
   scene.add(spotLight.target)
   ```

5. Added rotation animation to the Earth model in the animation loop:
   ```typescript
   // Animation loop
   const animate = (): void => {
     requestAnimationFrame(animate)
     
     // Rotate the Earth model if it's loaded
     if (earth) {
       earth.rotation.y += 0.005; // Slow rotation around y-axis
     }
     
     renderer.render(scene, camera)
   }
   ```

6. Tested the implementation by running the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Result
Successfully replaced the simple Earth sphere with a detailed 3D Earth model. The model shows continents and oceans, rotates around its axis, and is properly illuminated with enhanced lighting. The model interacts with the spacetime grid, which still deforms based on the planet's mass as controlled by the slider.

## Key Technical Decisions
- Used Vite's URL import feature (`?url` suffix) to properly load the GLTF model
- Set the model to be fully opaque by explicitly setting `transparent = false` and `opacity = 1.0` for all materials
- Enhanced the lighting with multiple light sources from different angles to better illuminate the Earth model
- Added a spotlight specifically targeting the Earth to highlight its details
- Implemented a fallback to the original sphere if the model fails to load
- Added rotation animation to make the Earth model more dynamic
- Scaled the model appropriately to match the scene scale

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Path Resolution**: Initially used an absolute path (`/src/planet_earth/scene.gltf`) which caused loading issues. Solved by using Vite's URL import feature with a relative path.
- **Model Visibility**: The model was initially too dark and details were not visible. Solved by enhancing the lighting with multiple light sources and increasing their intensity.
- **Transparency Issues**: The model appeared somewhat transparent. Solved by explicitly setting all materials to be opaque.
- **Code Organization**: Encountered issues with the replace_in_file tool causing duplicate code. Solved by using write_to_file to completely rewrite the file with the correct content.
