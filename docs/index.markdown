# Project Overview: Relativity Spacetime

This project is a simulation designed for a science fair context, aiming to explore and visualize concepts from Einstein's theories of relativity.

## Core Concepts Explored:

*   **Special Relativity:** Focuses on the effects of velocity on spacetime, particularly time dilation.
*   **General Relativity:** Investigates the influence of gravity on spacetime, including gravitational time dilation.
*   **Four-Velocity:** Explores the concept of velocity in four-dimensional spacetime.

## Purpose:

The primary goal is to provide an interactive visualization that helps in understanding how velocity and gravity affect time and space according to relativistic physics.
